This file lists the changes to Pecube that have been made by Todd Ehlers' Earth
Surface Processes research group.

Major Changes (summary):
- Prediction of AHe, ZFT, ZHe, ZFT and Musc Ar/Ar ages.  AHe age prediction includes the
  effects of grain size and alpha damage.
- Loading of multiple topography files
- Choice of 4 different kinematic fields
- UTM or degrees for spatial coordinates
- Output of surface erosion rates at each time step
- Output of surface ages and their thermal histories at requested time steps
- Temporal variation in surface T B/C
- Variable node z-direction node plane spacing
- Option for radiogenic heat production that decreases exponentially
- Thermal model material properties now input as measured values; conductivity is calculated
- Added PDF calculation for cascade catchments or individual basins for non-cascade model
- Added monte carlo test to compare calculated PDFs to measured data PDFs

Bugs/Untested features/Features not yet implemented:
- (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) The statistical comparison of observed and predicted ages is broken 
  with the addition of age prediction at multiple times during the model run (e.g., array 
  dimensions need to be updated)
- (POSSIBLY RESOLVED) Large, high-resolution or long time span models crash with either no notification -or-
  a segmentation fault.  Suspect memory issues. PLEASE REPORT IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH THIS!
- (IN REVISION) New Nepal kinematics still in revision

*** The Pecube.in file has been heavily modified to accomodate the changes below ***
*** It is strongly suggested you modify that file, rather than try to retrofit   ***
*** your older versions                                                          ***

ages_header.f90 (NEW)
- Created ages_header subroutine to generate Tecplot-formatted age output
  Input: (from Pecube, no additional)
  Output: Ages_tec***.dat files

create_pecube_in.f90 (MODIFIED)
- Added ability to load multiple topography files
  - Files can either be listed individually, or by prefix (e.g., for CASCADE outputs)
  - If fewer topo files are listed than time steps, the final topo file will be used
    for all subsequent time steps
  - If more topo files are listed than time steps, program quits
- Added flag to specify the kinematic velocity field geometry
  - 1 = vertical exhumation
  - 2 = non-vertical exhumation (same angle and velocity in entire model domain)
  - 3 = listric fault (e.g., original Pecube default)
  - 4 = Nepal model geometry
- Added ability to have spatial dimensions in either degrees or UTM
- Now reads in measured thermal model material properties and calculates the diffusivity
- Now reads in Nepal thermal model inputs from Pecube.in

erates.f90 (NEW)
- Creates erates subroutine to output erosion rates at the surface for each model time step

    and the true surface erosion rate (combination of those)
  Input: (from Pecube, no additional)
  Output: erates_tec***.dat files

make_matrix.f90 (MODIFIED)
- Modified to pass the additional variables into the geometry subroutine called within this
  subroutine
- Changed the code to allow for variable surface temperature with time (as topography evolves)
- Modified code to allow exponentially decreasing heat production
- Code can now use Nepal model material properties

Muscovite.f (NEW)
- Adapted the Muscovite.f code from the Quantitative Thermochronology book for use in Pecube

Pecube.f90 (MODIFIED)
- Modified to load multiple topography files (see create_pecube_in.f90)
- Modified to track several sets of surface nodes to predict surface ages at each time step
- Modified to output the positon and thermal histories of each set of surface nodes (if desired)

  each time step (including the kinematic field; see tec_mat_output.f90)
