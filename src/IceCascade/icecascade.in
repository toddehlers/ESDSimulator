# 1 = tecplot formatted file:
#       File needs to include number of nodes, and then colums for x,y,h,h0 for each node.
#       h and h0 are the surface and bedrock elevations (?)
#       the difference between the two is the sediment thickness

# INPUT D9 *** number of extra nodes to add in x and y direction for the shelf area added (if any).
# These nodes will only be added to the 'shelf' area, and can be set to have a coarser mesh on the edges of the model.
# Suggestion is to add both distances (e.g. Exl+Exr) from above and use an average
# node spacing of your liking.  This method is best used when reading a mesh.
# In that scenario, your shelf can have different nodal spacings.
# If you are generating new topograpy, make sure nxe, nye will generate
# the spacing you prefer (i.e. what nx and ny give you in INPUT D1).
# Essentially if a new mesh is generated, spacing in the model domain as well as on the 
# shelf will be the same, so make sure nxe and nye (in relation to Exl,Exr,Eyd,Eyl) will
# give the proper nodal spacing.  Initialize_nodal_geometry.f90 does not differentiate between
# shelf and regular nodes.  Read_nodal_geometry.f90 does differentiate, so a different 
# mesh spacing is possible if reading in a mesh.
# Note: you can run IceCascade for one time step and use that topography as an input mesh in order to
# use a different node spacing

# For method 1, this value is the maximum possible slope, but landslides can occur on slopes
# less than this value.  As slope steepens, the probability increases that a landslide will occur.

# INPUT F8 *** Landslide frequency scaling parameters for lsmethod 1, suggested (?) values
# xk0, a coefficient used along with time since last landslide for a given node to calculate
# probability of a landslide occurring at that node.  Can be thought of as a 'preparation' timescale
# i.e. if you have a landslide, it will take some time (related to xk0) before another landslide
# will occur. I (Brian) guess this means that if you set to 0, landslide probability will not depend on time since last landslide. 
# xk1, is the number of landslides per timescale set by dtc (below) for the average deluany area per node. 
# So if xk1=1 and dtc=100, then on average 1 landslide will occur every 100 yrs at a given node. 
# dtc is a measure of landslide frequency used in the probabilistic calculations.  Used to divide
# both the current timestep length as well as the time since last landslide to calculate a
# landslide probability for a given node.
