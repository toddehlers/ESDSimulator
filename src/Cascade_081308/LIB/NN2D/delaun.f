c	delaun - calculates delaunay triangulation incrementally 
c	 	 for a set of points in 2-D using a variation of
c		 Lawson's algorithm.
c
c	Input:
c		points(2,np)		array of node co-ordinates
c		num			number of nodes to be used
c               vis_tlist(nv_max)       List of triangles visible from 
c					current point.
c               vis_elist(nv_max)       List of edges visible from 
c					current point.
c               add_tlist(nv_max)       work array used by routine addpoint
c               eps                     distance from an interface for a
c                                       a point to be considered on an
c                                       interface (real*8). Prevents zero
c                                       area triangles resulting from rounding
c                                       error when nodes are co-linear.
c		nv_max			size of work arrays
c		mode			(=0,1,2,3) operation mode (see below)
c		inactive(np)		logical array. If mode=1 then the i-th
c					node is ignored if active(i) = .true.
c		nfirst			If mode=3 then nfirst is the first
c					node added to an existing triangulation
c		itstart			If mode=3 then itstart is a first
c					guess triangle containing node first node
c		subset(np)		logical array. If mode=2 then only
c					the nodes (subset(i),i=1,num) are used.
c
c	Output:
c               v(3,*)           	array of triangle vertices
c               numtri                  number of triangles in current
c                                       triangulation.
c               e(3,*)                  adjacency matrix of neighbouring
c                                       triangles. e(i,j) is the triangle
c                                       which shares the face containing
c                                       node (mod(i,3)+1) and (mod(i,3)+2) 
c					in triangle j, stored counterclockwise 
c					about j.  
c                                       (This is the `opposite' definition)
c
c	Comments:
c
c       This routine calculates the Delaunay triangulation of a set of nodes 
c	using a variation of Lawson's method.  Each node is added sequentially 
c	and the Delaunay triangulation is updated. If the new node is inside 
c	the convex hull of the existing triangulation then the standard Lawson 
c	method is used. If it is outside then the list of triangle edges 
c	which are visible from the new point is calculated using routine 
c	visiblelist and each of these is used as the start of the swapping 
c	routine addpoint.
c
c	Four different operation modes are allowed.
c
c	MODE = 0:
c	The `standard' mode. All nodes from 1 to num are included. The arrays 
c	`subset' and `inactive' are unused and may be set to dummy variables
c       (saving memory). The variables nfirst and itstart are also unused.
c
c	MODE = 1:
c	All nodes from 1 to num are included except those for which
c	inactive(i) is set to true. The array `subset' is unused and may
c	be set to a dummy variable (saving memory). The variables nfirst 
c	and itstart are also unused.
c
c	MODE = 2:
c	Only nodes from subset(1) to subset(num) are included. The array
c	`inactive' is unused and may be set to a dummy variable
c	(saving memory). The variables nfirst and itstart are also unused.
c
c	MODE = 3:
c	Used to add nodes from nfirst to num to an existing triangulation.
c	Nodes for which inactive(i) is set to true are ignored.
c	The array `subset' is unused and may be set to a dummy variable.
c
c       The performance may be sensitive to the order in which the nodes are
c       added so these can be sorted before calling this routine if desired.
c
c	This routine was converted to use the `opposite' definition of
c	the adjacency matrix on 30/1/96.
c
c
c	Calls are made to Triloc_del,visiblelist,insert_point,addpoint.
