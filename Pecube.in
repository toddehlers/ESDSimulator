$ Input file for running Pecube-D.  University of Tuebingen, Germany (18 May, 2015).
$ Report bugs noticed with this version to Todd Ehlers (todd.ehlers@uni-tuebingen.de).
$
$ This version of Pecube is based on the distrubtion by Jean Braun.  It has been
$ Modified substatially to account for
$ a.  Calculation of predicted ages for different thermo- geochronometer systems.
$ b.  Many different options for user defined velocity input fields (e.g. McQuarrie and
$     Ehlers, 2015).
$ c.  Different output format options.
$ d.  calculation of detrital cooling ages for user defined sample points on the topog.
$      (e.g. Whipp et al., 2009)
$ e.  Iterative Inversion of cooling ages for topographic change scenarios (e.g. Olen et al. 2012)
$ f.  Monte Carlo Inversion of cooling ages to identify the denudation histories that
$     that can produce observed ages.  (e.g. Thiede & Ehlers, 2013)
$ g.  Coupling with CASCADE or IceCascade (e.g Yanites and Ehlers, 2013 EPSL)
$ and numerous other significant changes to age prediction, heat production, shear
$ heating, kinematics, and thermal history output
$ are highlighted in the readme folders in  /docs folder. Different options have also been added
$ for simulation other kinematic fields including an ellipsoidal exhumation field, as well as
$ a coupling to 2D Move restoration files. Note - use of the 2D Move output for velocity fields
$ also requires the program velocity.py.
$
$ Significant program changes have been made to this version with thanks to Willi Kappler,
$ David Whipp, and Chris Spath.  If you use this program for publications the references that

$
$ *** HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THIS PROGRAM ***
$ This version of Pecube is compiled with MPI so that it can run on multicore machines.  This is not
$ normally needed if you are doing a single simulation.  However, if you are using the
$ Monte Carlo or Genetic search algorithm then it can run multiple jobs at once.
$
$ The implications of this are that:
$ 1. You have to have a version of MPI installed on your machine.  We are using OpenMPI, but others will likely
$ work.
$
$ 2. Compile the program using scons.  On our system this is done with scons --use-mpi, and then scons -c to clean
$ out the .o files.
$
$ 3. To run the program you need to have the pecube.in file in the same directory as the executable, and then
$ start the job with mpi run.  For example, on our system we do:
$
$  mpirun -n pecube
$
$ Where -n is the number of cores you want to use.  If you are only running 1 job, then there is likely no speed
$ difference if N=1 or N=8.  So, for 1 job, you write
$ mpirun -n 1 pecube.

$ (Input 1) Name of the run (also the name of the folder in which the solution is stored)
$ NOTE: You might need to create this folder manually before running Pecube.

output/Pecube-D

$ (Input 2) Number of topography files to be loaded (should be number of time steps+1)
$ 0 = No topography file will be loaded
$ 1 = The same topo file will be used for all time steps. (note relief can still
$     change as specified below). Note the number of time steps, or steps in the
$     tectonomorphic scenario is defined later.
$ >1 = A new topo file will be loaded for each timestep
$ If fewer topo files are listed then the number of time steps, the model will
$   use the last topo file for the subsequent/remaining time steps.
$ When multiple topography files are loaded Pecube will exponentially morph
$   between the two topographies over the given time step.  tau, specified below
$   determines the exponential rate of change in the topography.

0

$ (Input 3) Flag for topography input
$ 1 = User will list all topography file names below, one file on each new line
$ 2 = User specifies file prefix (see Input 4) and Pecube will load all
$     files with that prefix plus a 4 digit number after it.
$ 3 = All listed topography files are exported from 2d move
$

1

$ (Input 4) Name of the topo file used
$ "Nil" = Topography is assumed to be flat for that time step
$ Otherwise the file should contain nx by ny elevation points (see below)
$    defining the topography in meters
$ Note that the evolution of this topography (in amplitude and elevation offset)
$    can change at each time step, as specified below in Input 12.
$ If multiple topography files are being loaded with a user defined filename
$    prefix filename (e.g., option 2 above) then format is:
$    prefix = "topo_input" (or another user-defined name)
$    which will load files topo_input0000.dat, topo_input0001.dat, etc.
$ Note: If detrital age calculation for a Cascade mesh is specified (value of 1
$       for Input 18) then the topo files must be named topo_pecube_0000.dat,
$       topo_pecube_0001.dat, etc or the prefix topo_pecube_ if automating it

Nil

$ (Input 5) Coordinate system flag for Pecube input
$ 1 = Degrees
$ 2 = UTM (meters)

2

$ (Input 6) Number of points (nx, ny) in the longitude and latitude directions
$   of the topography file being loaded.
$ Note: The shell script make_topo.sh will output this information to the screen
$   if you are using this to create your topo files from ArcGIS grids

2 2

$ (Input 7) Spacing of longitude and latitude points (in degrees or meters) in
$   the topography input file.
$ Note: The shell script make_topo.sh will also output this information if you
$   use the script to export an ArcGIS DEM grid to Pecube format. Units of the
$   values below should agree with what is specified in Input 5.

1000 1000

$ (Input 8) Skipping factor (nskip) for points in the topo input file
$ 1 = All points of the topography are used
$ 2 = Every second point is used, etc.
$ Note: nx, ny AND nskip define the resolution of the finite element mesh in the
$   horizontal directions

1

$ (Input 9) Geographic location for the origin (bottom left corner) of the
$   Pecube grid.
$ Specify the longitude and latitude (in degrees or meters) of the bottom left
$   corner of the topography file. Units must match above units.
$ NOTE: a) You can set this value to be 0,0 for synthetic topography, or it
$   can be 85670 (utm x), 983443 (utm y) or 109.756 (degrees long), 42.235
$   (degrees lat) if you want Pecube to georeference the grid to your gegraphic
$   area of study.
$ NOTE: b) If you are using a DEM to generate the topography you want to specify
$   an offset below that is 1/2 the topo file spacing specified in Input 7.
$   (e.g., (DEM reolution / 2))

0. 0.

$ (Input 10) Number of time steps in the tectonomorphic scenario for your
$   simulation
$ An integer number (>= 1) is required. The value should be 1 less than the
$   number of time step inputs defined in Input 12 below.
$ Examples: a value of 1 will require two input lines for Input 12 below (a line
$   for the starting time condition and one for the final time step condition).
$   A value of 2 below will require 3 lines in Input 12 below. In this case, the
$   first line would be the starting time condition, the second line would be
$   the condition at some intermediate time, and final (third) line would be the
$   final model condition.

4

$ (Input 11) Erosional time scale (tau, in Ma) for topographic change
$   This input allows the user to have non-linear morphing of topography with
$   time.  A large value (e.g., 1000) will generate essentially linear changes
$   between the input topography files.  Effectively, this is the e-folding time
$   for the topographic evolution, a.k.a. the exponential decay rate of
$   topography.

1000.

$ (Input 12a) Definition of the tectonomorphic time steps
$ NOTE: The number of lines should be 1 greater than the value specified in
$   Input 10.
$ Each line formatted as follows:
$ (a) Time (in Ma in the past)
$   NOTES: (i) The first time step (first line) calculates a steady state
$     thermal solution with the prescribed parameters
$   (ii) Any transient features will occur between the previous listed time step
$     line and the current time step line. For example, for a model with 3 time
$     steps, a 50% decrease in topographic relief and change in the velocity
$     field desired in the final time step would be listed on the last two
$     lines, where the desired final relief and velocity field over that time
$     are listed on the final time step line
$
$ (b) Amplification factor for relief change
$   1 = static topography
$   2 = 200% increase in relief over this time step
$   0.5 = 50% decrease in relief over this time step
$
$ (c) Vertical offset factor (in km) for static topography elevation shifts
$   during simulation.
$   0 = No shift in surface elevations
$   2 = Increase in all surface elevations by 2 km over this time step
$   Why would you use this?  Well, if relief is 2 km, with a mean of 1 km, and
$     relief is decreasing by 50% then if you specify a value of 0.5 (km) here
$     it would shift your mean elevation such that it would remain at 1 km.
$
$ (d) Flag for output of time-temperature histories
$   Enabling this will output temperature, time, x, y and z positions for all
$     surface points at each step where listed.
$   0 = No output of thermal history at the time step
$   1 = Output of thermal history at the time step
$   Note: Because the first time step is a steady state calculation, there is no
$     thermal history available for the first time step.
$   If the entire thermal history is wanted for surface points at t = 0Ma, then
$     the user should set this flag for thermal output at the last time step
$     specified below
$
$ (e) Kinematic field flag (details of kinematic field specified in subsequent
$   inputs)
$   1 = vertical movement (erosion only)
$   2 = uniform diagonal movement
$   3 = listric fault
$   4 = New Nepal thrust belt model for rotated model (Whipp testing - 10/07)
$   5 = Parabolic uplift field (S. Olen testing - 06/10)
$   6 = Ellipsoid uplift field (M. Schmiddunser - 07/11)
$       An inner and outer ellipse and the uplift rates for the three corresponding
$       areas are specified. The uplift rate between the inner and outer ellipse will
$       be interpolated between the inner and the outer uplift rate
$   7 = As 6, but uses a different function for uplift rate calculation that produces
$       a smoothed uplift profile
$   8 = velocity file names
$
$ (f) Details of kinematics (Peklet)
$   If e=1, value here is the erosion rate (mm/yr)
$   If e=2, value here is the magnitude of the velocity vector at which material
$     is moving laterally (mm/yr) in an Eulerian reference frame
$   If e=3, value here is the maximum slip velocity on fault (mm/yr)
$   If e=4, enter 1, values for velocities are computed within code and scaled
$     by 1 here

$ (Input 18) Flag to calculate detrital age distributions for catchments
$ First line:  0 = no detrital calculation; 1 = detrital calcuation
$ Note:  If a series of CASCADE topographies were loaded in then
$ set Input 18 of the Pecube.in file to be 1, Pecube will output the detrital
$ ages of every cascade catchment at every timestep.  These files will be created
$ in the 'catchments' folder within your output run directory.  It will create the
$ 'catchments' folder if it does not exist there.  The files will be named as
$ 'Timestep_0001_Catchment_0001.dat' and so on for all catchments and timesteps.
$ All the program needs to run properly is to have the tecplot formatted cascade
$ output files for every timestep (eg. 'topo_tec_0001.dat') in
$ the 'output/Cascade' directory
$
$ Specifying user defined basins in a file causes Pecube to open the file and read it.
$ The file should contain lines with the following syntax:
$
$ <xpos> <ypos> <age type> <Nil or filename> <yes/Yes or no/No>
$ Ex: 64.8495 128.5548 1 Nil No
$
$ Where xpos is the x value of the basin outlet and ypos is the y value.  The age type is a number 1-11 with the
$ following coding:
$
$ 1 = Apatite Helium Age - Farley, 2000
$ 2 = Apatite Helium Age - Small grain size
$ 3 = Apatite Helium Age - Medium grain size
$ 4 = Apatite Helium Age - Large grain size
$ 5 = Apatite Helium Age - Low radiation damage
$ 6 = Apatite Helium Age - Medium radiation damage
$ 7 = Apatite Helium Age - High radiation damage
$ 8 = Apatite Fission Track Age
$ 9 = Zircon Helium Age
$ 10 = Zircon Fission Track Age
$ 11 = Muscovite Age
$
$ The next entry for each basin line can be 'Nil' or a filename.  If 'Nil' is specified, then Pecube uses
$ the TAPES-Grid method of finding upstream points of the basin outlet.  Then, it will write out the x, y,
$ and z positions along with the age data for the upstream points into the main run output directory with
$ the naming convention of 'Timestep_0001_Basin_X_64.8495_Y_128.5548.dat'.  Also, the PDF for each basin is
$ written to the folder 'pdf_data' within the run output directory with the naming convention of
$ 'Timestep_0001_Basin_X_64.8495_Y_128.5548_Agetype_01_pdf.dat'. If a filename is specified as the entry
$ on the line, then Pecube will open this file and read in each line of data with the format:
$
$ <age> <error>
$ Ex: 35.756469 1.07269407
$
$ Where the age and error are absolute values. The PDF for each of these basins is created in the 'pdf_data'
$ folder in the run output directory with the naming convention of 'Basin_X_64.8495_Y_128.5548_Agetype_01_pdf.dat'.
$
$ The final entry on each line is a 'yes' or 'no' on whether the user wants to run the Monte Carlo test for that specified
$ basin.  For the Monte Carlo test to run properly there must be two basins with the same outlet point (x and y positions) and
$ EACH must have a 'yes' to run the monte carlo routine. Also, the age types MUST be the same or the Monte Carlo test is not run.
$ An example of correct syntax for the Monte Carlo routine to run properly is as follows:
$
$ 64.8495 128.5548 7 Nil Yes
$ 64.8495 128.5548 7 datafile.txt Yes
$
$ Please note that if any or all of these criteria for running the Monte Carlo test are not met, then the program simple does not
$ run the comparison (skips it) and does not output anything for it.
$
$ Note: The subdirectories in the run output directory where Pecube writes most of these files will be
$       automatically created by Pecube if they do not exist already.
